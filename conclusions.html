                <h2>What is a Blockchain?</h2>
                <p>A blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers in a way that ensures the security, transparency, and integrity of the data. It allows for the creation of tamper-proof records that can be accessed by all participants in a network, eliminating the need for intermediaries. Each block in the chain contains a set of transactions and a cryptographic hash of the previous block, linking them together securely.</p>

                <h2>Economic Sustainability</h2>
                <p>Blockchains can enhance economic sustainability by reducing transaction costs and increasing efficiency in supply chains, enabling businesses to operate more cost-effectively. Additionally, they facilitate new business models, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), that can empower underserved populations and foster economic inclusion.</p>

                <h2>Social Sustainability</h2>
                <p>In terms of social sustainability, blockchains can promote transparency and trust in various sectors, such as voting and charity, by ensuring that records are immutable and publicly accessible. They also have the potential to enhance data ownership for individuals, allowing for better control over personal information and fostering a more equitable digital environment.</p>

                <h2>Environmental Sustainability</h2>
                <p>Blockchains can contribute to environmental sustainability by enabling more efficient resource management and tracking of supply chains, which can reduce waste and optimize energy use. Furthermore, innovative blockchain applications, such as carbon credit trading platforms, can support initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting renewable energy.</p>
