                <h2>Blockchain's Impact on the Environment</h2>
                <p> Blockchain technology, especially proof-of-work systems like Bitcoin, exerts a major environmental toll due to its immense energy demands. Mining, the process through which new transactions are verified and added to the blockchain, requires solving complex algorithms that consume a staggering amount of electricity. Bitcoin alone consumes around 110 terawatt hours (TWh) annually — comparable to the energy consumption of small countries like Sweden or Malaysia. A United Nations study estimated that in 2020-2021, the global Bitcoin mining network consumed about 173.42 TWh of electricity, meaning that if Bitcoin were its own country, its energy consumption would rank 27th worldwide. The resulting carbon emissions were substantial, equivalent to burning 84 billion pounds of coal, operating 190 natural gas power plants, or the output of roughly 3.9 billion trees needed to offset these emissions.   </p>

                <h2>Blockchains & Fossil Fuels</h2>
                <p>
                    The energy source mix used by Bitcoin also worsens its environmental impact. Approximately 45% of the energy used in Bitcoin mining is generated by coal, with another 21% by natural gas, meaning fossil fuels supply two-thirds of its total energy. Only a fraction comes from renewables, with hydropower supplying 16% and solar and wind contributing a mere 2% and 5%, respectively.
                    <br><br>This reliance on fossil fuels makes Bitcoin mining particularly carbon-intensive; to offset China’s coal-intensive Bitcoin mining operations alone would require planting about 2 billion trees — an area equivalent to Portugal and Ireland combined or 45,000 times the size of Central Park in New York City. 
                    <br><br> The water footprint associated with Bitcoin mining is also noteworthy; enough water is consumed to fill 660,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools, which could supply drinking water to over 300 million people in rural sub-Saharan Africa. The environmental strain extends to land use, with Bitcoin’s global mining operations occupying a land footprint 1.4 times the area of Los Angeles.

                <h2>Proof-of-Work</h2>
                <p>It is essential to note that the high energy consumption of PoW blockchains is neither the result of inefficient algorithms nor of outdated hardware. Strikingly, such blockchains are “energy-intensive by design”. It is their high energy consumption that protects PoW blockchains from attacks: Depending on the scenario, an attacker must bear at least 25 to 50% of the total computing power that participating miners use for mining – and, thus, the same proportion of the total energy consumption (under the assumption of equal hardware) – to be able to successfully manipulate or control the system (Eyal and Sirer 2014). Consequently, the more valuable a PoW cryptocurrency is, the better it is protected against attacks, confirming that PoW is, indeed, a thoughtful design.</p>

                <h2>Proof-of-Stakes</h2>
                <p>The probably best-known alternative for the permissionless systems required for cryptocurrencies and other open decentralized applications is the so-called Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.
                Ethereum, one of the largest blockchain networks, recently shifted to a proof-of-stake mechanism, which drastically reduces its energy needs by approximately 99.95%.

                <h2>Comparisons and Conclusions</h2>
                <p>Efforts to curb blockchain’s environmental toll have begun to take shape. In March 2022, the White House issued an executive order on the responsible development of digital assets to mitigate the environmental impacts of crypto-assets. Ethereum, one of the largest blockchain networks, recently shifted to a proof-of-stake mechanism, which drastically reduces its energy needs by approximately 99.95%. Blockchain is also being leveraged to advance sustainability, with projects focused on tracking carbon footprints, improving supply chain transparency, and supporting green investments. In India, for instance, homeowners in Uttar Pradesh use blockchain to facilitate peer-to-peer solar energy trading, allowing for real-time exchanges at current prices. Such applications showcase blockchain’s potential to drive environmental solutions — but overcoming scalability and data accuracy challenges is essential if blockchain is to become a sustainable force in technology.</p>
