                <h2>Blockchains and Economic Sustainability</h2>
                <p> Blockchains can enhance economic sustainability by reducing transaction costs, improving transparency and accountability. </b>
When it comes to transparency, blockchains significantly improve upon this, especially in business operations and logistics. This is done by providing the correct information and real-time tracking of shipments and data that all parties have access to. Since all participants can see this information, this openness helps deter and prevent errors and fraud in record keeping. This creates more trust and security which in turn can provide more economic opportunity for these parties. Participants can also verify their transactions independently, which is another layer of security that is added. 
            </b>Cost reduction comes come play here since this method not only allows you to streamline the process but also the need for intermediaries. </p>

                <h3>Proof-of-Work</h3>
                <p>It is essential to note that the high energy consumption of PoW blockchains is neither the result of inefficient algorithms nor of outdated hardware. Strikingly, such blockchains are “energy-intensive by design”. It is their high energy consumption that protects PoW blockchains from attacks: Depending on the scenario, an attacker must bear at least 25 to 50% of the total computing power that participating miners use for mining – and, thus, the same proportion of the total energy consumption (under the assumption of equal hardware) – to be able to successfully manipulate or control the system (Eyal and Sirer 2014). Consequently, the more valuable a PoW cryptocurrency is, the better it is protected against attacks, confirming that PoW is, indeed, a thoughtful design.</p>
