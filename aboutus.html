                <h2>Dan Cardenas</h2>
                <p>My name is Dan, and I have already been a technician for over 10 years,
                 with my cyber security degree I would like to work for a company as a Sys Admin or 
                Head Tech consultant. My other interests are Pen Tester or network engineer. One thing I
                would love is to work remote so I can travel for more flexibility.</p>

                <h2>James Loesche</h2>
                <p>I am James Loesche. I am a cybersecurity major, originally started on computer 
                    science but realized what I truly wanted to study. I currently only need one 
                    more year to graduate and am off to operate in the real world. I hope that I can 
                    get into a job that allows me to exercise and grow my cybersecurity repertoire</p>
