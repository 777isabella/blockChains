                <h2>Blockchains and Economic Sustainability</h2>
                <p> Blockchains can enhance economic sustainability by reducing transaction costs, improving transparency and accountability. </b>
When it comes to transparency, blockchains significantly improve upon this, especially in business operations and logistics. This is done by providing the correct information and real-time tracking of shipments and data that all parties have access to. Since all participants can see this information, this openness helps deter and prevent errors and fraud in record keeping. This creates more trust and security which in turn can provide more economic opportunity for these parties. Participants can also verify their transactions independently, which is another layer of security that is added. 
            </b>Cost reduction comes come play here since this method not only allows you to streamline the process but also the need for intermediaries. </p>
