                    this involves examining career opportunities, working conditions, inclusivity, ethical concerns, and its potential for societal 
                    improvement.</p>

                    <li><b>Skill Gap:</b> Blockchain is a specialized field requiring expertise in cryptography, distributed systems, and smart contracts. This creates barriers for entry, particularly for those without advanced technical skills or access to higher education.</li>
                    <br><li><b>Learning Resources:</b> The availability of online courses, certifications (e.g., by IBM, Coursera, or edX), and university programs can help bridge the skill gap.</li>

                        but may also blur boundaries between work and personal life.</li>
                    <br><li><b>Compensation:</b> Salaries for blockchain professionals are often competitive, especially for skilled developers and consultants.</li>
